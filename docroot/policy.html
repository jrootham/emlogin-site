		 	<h2>Policies</h2>
		 	<p>
		 		This page describes possible policies for user names and emails depending on the type of site.
		 	</p>

		 	<h3>Test Sites</h3>
		 	<p>
		 		Test sites (like this one, which is a test bed site for a log in app) can have very loose policies.  Here the policy on users is very loose.  Any new user name is valid and email addresses can be reused.  This makes it easy to generate test accounts.
		 	</p>

		 	<h3>Off Line Registration Sites</h3>
		 	<p>
		 		Sites with off line registration systems are typically membership organizations.  They would normally have membership numbers (or other unique identifiers) which can be used to identify members on log in.  They may or may not permit members to share email addresses.  If they do, those members may impersonate one another.
		 	</p>

		 	<h3>Uncontrolled Registration Sites</h3>
		 	<p>
		 		Sites which let anyone register will probably require unique email addresses in order prevent sign up floods.
		 	</p>

		 	<h3>Controlled Registration Sites</h3>
		 	<p>
		 		Sites which vet registration applications have the option of requiring unique email addresses or not.
		 	</p>

		 	<h3>Sites Without User Names</h3>
		 	<p>
		 		Such sites probably are built to control access to data.  There is no communication between users on such sites.  Anybody with access to an email account registered to the site may access them.
