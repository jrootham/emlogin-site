		 	<h1>No Password</h1>
		 	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		 	<p>
		 		A new style of authentication is becoming popular.  Instead of passwords an email is sent to the person trying to log in with a link which contains a token.  Following the link logs the person in.  This system depends on the person maintaining control of their email address, but means they no longer have to invent strong passwords and websites no longer have to store passwords.
		 	</p>
		 	<p>
		 		This website is a test bed for a proposed app which will automate the process.
