		 	<h1>No Password</h1>
		 	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		 	<p>
		 		A new style of authentication is becoming popular. Instead of using passwords an email is sent to the email address of the person who wishes to log in.  That email contains a link. Clicking on the link logs the person in. This system eliminates the need for users to create and retain strong passwords and for websites to store and protect those passwords.
		 	</p>
		 	<p>
		 		This website is a test bed for a proposed app which will automate the process.
		 	</p>

On the registration page you enter a user name (blanks and special characters are allowed).   You also enter an email address.  Hitting the "Register" button will send an email to that address. There is a link in that email: "Login".  Hitting that link will log you into the site.

		 		If you have already registered, the "No Password Login Request" link below will let you log into the site. You enter your user name. Hitting the "Request login" button will send an email to the address you specified. That email will say "Login". Hitting that link will log you into the site.
